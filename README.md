## ðŸš¦ Git Workflow Guidelines

We use a simplified Git flow based on the following branch strategy:

### ðŸ”€ Branching Model

| Branch      | Purpose                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready release branch    |
| `develop`   | Integration branch for ongoing dev |
| `feature/*` | Feature-specific development       |
| `fix/*`     | Hotfix or bugfix branches          |

### ðŸ“Œ Rules

- **Always branch off `develop`** when starting a new feature.
- **Use Pull Requests** to merge `feature/*` or `fix/*` into `develop`.
